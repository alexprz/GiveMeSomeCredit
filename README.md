**Why is this project on GitHub ?**

This project has been made as part of our lessons at ENPC school.
It is not made to be reused as it does not bring anything particular
to the community (it is not a package).
Why is it on GitHub then ?
There may be 2 reasons for this project to be hosted on GitHub:
- To collaborate with my project partner (if any).
- To be able to show some projects and code to recruiters.

With this in mind, here are the files to look at.

**Where to look at ?**

```main.ipynb```  
The jupyter notebook containing all the code and comments.
